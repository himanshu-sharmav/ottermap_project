# OtterMap

**OtterMap** is a Django-based web application designed for shop registration and search functionality. Users can register their shops with specific geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) and search for shops based on their current location. The application utilizes Django Rest Framework for API creation and Sphinx for documentation generation.

## Key Features

- **Shop Registration**: Users can register their shops by providing essential details such as shop name, latitude, and longitude.
- **Shop Search**: Users can search for shops based on their current location. The application calculates the distance between the user's location and registered shops, sorting them by proximity.
- **RESTful API**: The application provides a RESTful API for shop registration and searching using Django Rest Framework.
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation is generated using Sphinx, ensuring that developers can easily understand and use the provided endpoints.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The application includes a simple and intuitive web interface for both shop registration and searching.
